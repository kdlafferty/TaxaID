# CLAUDE.md — TaxaID Ecosystem
# Ecosystem-level context for Claude Code. Auto-loaded from any package subdirectory.
# Package-specific context lives in each package's own CLAUDE.md.
# Last updated: 2026-07-01 (Session 125 — TaxaLikely::.xc_recording_count() fixed: Xeno-canto v2→v3 migration; TaxaLikely::correct_training_bias() added for classifier training-count bias correction)

## ⚙️ Claude Code Behavior
- After completing any task, play a completion sound: `afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff`
- Always ask before making changes to multiple *existing* files at once, or before any deletions
- Run `devtools::check()` after any substantive edits to a package

---

## 📋 Pending Documentation Tasks
- **pkgdown sites**: No `_pkgdown.yml` exists for any package. Per the MEE TaxaID
  manuscript plan (manuscript-context.md in Cowork), the paper will follow the
  aniMotum precedent — a short "Application"-style paper that points readers to
  package vignettes/docs for depth rather than including a full tutorial. This
  requires each package (at least TaxaTools, TaxaFetch, TaxaHabitat, TaxaMatch,
  TaxaLikely, TaxaExpect, TaxaAssign, TaxaFlag) to have a working pkgdown site
  before submission. Flagged June 2026 during manuscript planning.

## ⚠️ Reminder for Claude
**At the start of any session involving function changes, new functions, or name changes:
remind the user to update CLAUDE.md — especially the Function Inventory — before ending
the session. Also add significant renames to `ecosystem_docs/NAME_CHANGE_HISTORY.md`.**

---

## ⚠️ File Loss Incident — 6 March 2026
Several TaxaExpect source files were lost during a USGS Git repository migration on
6 March 2026. Affected files were subsequently recreated from scratch. If any function
behaviour seems inconsistent with documentation, the recreated version is authoritative.
Functions confirmed recreated after the incident: `make_bbox_wkt`, `get_keys_from_context`,
`fetch_gbif_occurrences`, `create_sites_from_grid`, `optimize_grid_size`,
`filter_gbif_quality`, `assign_habitat_biological`.

## The TaxaID Ecosystem

| Package | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|
| TaxaTools | Name verification, cleaning, parsing, rank lookup, column standardisation; **LLM provider functions** (call_api, call_anthropic_api etc.); **LLM text generation** (draft_methods_text, draft_results_text); **GBIF backbone census** (census_genus_species); **Common name lookup** (common_to_scientific) | In development |
| TaxaFetch | Occurrence data acquisition (GBIF, DataONE, PDF, literature search), source combination | In development |
| TaxaHabitat | Habitat assignment via LLM, spatial QAQC; depends on TaxaTools for LLM calls | New (Session 28) |
| TaxaMatch | Sequence input (DADA2/FASTA), BLAST search, match standardization; BirdNET/image classifier ingestion | In development |
| TaxaLikely | Convert match scores to likelihoods using hierarchical Bayesian model; reference QC | New (Session 30) |
| TaxaExpect | Use occurrence and habitat data to estimate a theta prior for a taxon at a particular location | In development |
| TaxaAssign | Calculate posterior probability for a taxonomic assignment given a likelihood and a prior | Planned |
| TaxaFlag | Flag anomalous detections: contamination (lab/field blanks), allochthonous transport, taxonomic scope, handler artifacts | New (Session 60) |
| TaxaWizard | Conversational workflow designer: LLM-powered interview → .R script, .md methods, or Shiny app | New (Session 68) |

**Ecosystem logic (scored pathway):** TaxaTools cleans names → TaxaFetch fetches occurrence data → TaxaHabitat assigns habitats → TaxaMatch standardizes match data → TaxaLikely converts scores to likelihoods → TaxaExpect builds priors → TaxaAssign computes posteriors → TaxaFlag flags anomalous detections. TaxaWizard sits outside the dependency chain (generates scripts that call the other packages).

**Ecosystem logic (no-score pathway):** When match scores are unavailable or a single best candidate is returned, TaxaMatch and the likelihood model are bypassed. `TaxaLikely::unreferenced_candidates()` adds H2/H3 placeholder rows; `TaxaLikely::assign_scores()` sets likelihoods: (1) `score_type = "none"` — uniform likelihoods = 1.0, posteriors proportional to priors (morphology / expert IDs); (2) `score_type = "similarity_softmax"` — for single-score classifiers (e.g. BirdNET top-1), modulates likelihoods by classifier confidence; (3) upranked consensus — same as (1). `expand_consensus_candidates()` is deprecated (Session 99). Output feeds TaxaAssign normally.

**Dependency chain:** TaxaTools → TaxaFetch → TaxaHabitat → TaxaExpect → TaxaAssign → TaxaFlag
TaxaMatch → TaxaLikely → TaxaAssign → TaxaFlag
consensus df → TaxaLikely (unreferenced_candidates + assign_scores) → TaxaAssign → TaxaFlag
TaxaWizard: no TaxaID dependencies (uses metadata JSON files as interface)

**Package split notes:**
- Session 19: TaxaFetch split out of TaxaExpect (owns data acquisition)
- Session 28: TaxaHabitat split out of TaxaFetch (owns habitat assignment + spatial QAQC); LLM provider functions moved to TaxaTools
- Session 30: TaxaMatch scope revised to thin shell; TaxaLikely created to own score→likelihood conversion
- Session 60: TaxaFlag created for post-assignment anomalous detection flagging
- Session 68: TaxaWizard created for conversational workflow design (outside dependency chain)

**Licensing:** All packages use CC0 1.0 (public domain, per USGS policy). TaxaExpect depends on glmmTMB (GPL >= 3); source is CC0 but binary distributions bundling glmmTMB may be subject to GPL terms.

## Shared Data Interface

- Classification paths: pipe `|` delimited
- Rank labels: pipe `|` delimited, aligned positionally with classification path
- Spatial terminology (strict):
  - `point_id` = exact lat/lon coordinate identifier (created before gridding)
  - `grid_id` = aggregated spatial cell identifier (encodes location ONLY — never habitat)
- Likelihood / prior / posterior object structure: TBD — see TaxaAssign CLAUDE.md

## Developer Workflow Reminder (macOS / RStudio)

```r
devtools::document()   # ALWAYS: regenerates NAMESPACE and .Rd files
devtools::test()       # run tests within the package project (uses load_all)
devtools::install()    # required before using library(Package) from another project
```

**When to run what:**

| Situation | Command | Speed |
|---|---|---|
| Editing code, running `devtools::test()` inside the package | Nothing extra — `load_all()` is implicit | Fast |
| Changed roxygen docs or added/removed exports | `devtools::document()` | Fast |
| Need to use the package from another project (`library(Package)`) | `devtools::install()` | Slow |
| Stale namespace / unexplained errors after switching branches | Restart R, then `library(Package)` | Medium |

**Rule:** `document()` alone for in-package editing/testing; add `install()` when
switching to another project that calls the package.

**⚠️ Claude Code instruction: whenever you make changes that require reinstall,**
**end your response with an explicit "To apply these changes" block using this exact pattern:**

**If only TaxaTools changed:**
```r
.rs.restartR()
devtools::install("~/My Drive/Rscripts/projects/TaxaID/TaxaTools")
.rs.restartR()
```

**If multiple packages changed, or if unsure which downstream packages are affected:**
```r
.rs.restartR()
source("~/My Drive/Rscripts/projects/TaxaID/ecosystem_docs/install_all.R")
.rs.restartR()
```

**Always include two `.rs.restartR()` calls** — the first clears the stale session before
installing, the second ensures the freshly installed packages are loaded cleanly.
The `source()` line installs all packages in dependency order without opening each project.
Do not tell the user to use Session → Restart R or Cmd+Shift+F10 (does not work on this machine).

## Coding Conventions

- Native pipe `|>` throughout — never `%>%`
- `utils::globalVariables()` must be **first line** of every R file that uses NSE column names; omit entirely from files with no NSE references
- No blank lines inside `@param` roxygen blocks
- Helper/internal functions: `.` prefix + `@noRd`
- `package::function()` style for cross-package calls
- `%||%` exported from TaxaTools — never redefine in downstream packages; import via `@importFrom TaxaTools %||%`
- **`llm_fn` pattern**: LLM-calling functions accept `llm_fn = call_api` param (default via `getOption("TaxaID.llm_fn")`); users pass compatible wrapper for other providers

---

## ⚠️ Known R Footguns

### Split-string sprintf bug (recurring)
`sprintf()` does NOT concatenate multiple string arguments.
```r
# WRONG — crashes with "invalid format '%d'"
warning(sprintf("Message with %d items: ", "extra string", count))
# CORRECT
warning(sprintf("Message with %d items: extra string", count))
```
Check all `sprintf`/`warning`/`message`/`stop` calls before delivering any file.

### Roxygen blank lines inside @param
Blank line inside `@param` block → `devtools::document()` fails silently.

### read.csv numeric coercion of IUCN codes
`read.csv` parses `"9.2"` as `<double>`. Always `as.character()` before joining
against `.iucn_habitat_lookup$l2_code`.

### Logical parameter NA validation
`is.logical(NA)` returns `TRUE`. Always add `|| is.na(x)`:
```r
if (!is.logical(strict) || length(strict) != 1L || is.na(strict)) stop(...)
```

### \tabular in roxygen blocks
Use `\itemize` or `\describe` instead. If `devtools::document()` runs but does not
print "Writing <function>.Rd", a broken `\tabular` block is the first thing to check.

### taxon_match / geo_match column collision (Session 25)
`search_literature()` pre-initialises `geo_match = NA` and `taxon_match = NA`.
If screening fails partway and leaves stale values, a subsequent `left_join` creates
`.x`/`.y` duplicates. Always drop stale screening columns before rebuilding the prompt.

### prompt_api() breaking change (Session 26)
Renamed from `prompt_anthropic_api` to `prompt_api`. Params `model`, `max_tokens`,
`api_key` removed — now handled via closure passed to `llm_fn`. See TaxaFetch CLAUDE.md.

### PCRE `sub()` does not match newlines without `(?s)` (Session 33)
`sub(".*?(\\[[\\s\\S]*\\]).*", "\\1", x, perl=TRUE)` silently returns `x` unchanged
when `x` contains newlines, because `.*` in PCRE does not match `\n` by default.
Fix: add `(?s)` inline flag: `sub("(?s).*?(\\[...]\\]).*", "\\1", x, perl=TRUE)`.
This affected `assign_taxa_llm()` in TaxaAssign — LLM responses wrapped in markdown
fences were never parsed, causing all-NA `range_status` and uniform priors.

### `.resolve_llm_fn()` default silently degrades under fully-namespaced calls (Session 123)
`assign_taxa_llm()`, `run_llm_pipeline()`, `build_context()`, `suggest_unreferenced_species()`
(TaxaAssign) and `review_assignments()` (TaxaFlag) all default `llm_fn` to
`getOption("TaxaID.llm_fn", TaxaTools::call_api)`. `call_api()`'s provider
auto-detection depends on `TaxaTools::.onAttach()` having run, which only happens via
`library(TaxaTools)` — never via `TaxaTools::function()`. Code that calls these
functions using only namespaced (`::`) calls therefore never triggers auto-detection,
and `call_api()` **silently falls back to uniform/degraded output instead of
erroring**. No warning, no error — just a suspiciously uniform result. Caught only by
noticing the output looked wrong, in the TaxaID Layer-1 workflow scripts (which use
namespaced calls exclusively). Fix: always pass `llm_fn` explicitly when calling any
of the five functions above from a fully-namespaced script:
```r
llm_fn = getOption("TaxaID.llm_fn", TaxaTools::call_anthropic_api)
```

### Xeno-canto v2 API is dead; v2→v3 migration in Session 87 missed one call site (found Session 124, FIXED Session 125)
`ecosystem_docs/NAME_CHANGE_HISTORY.md` records the v2→v3 migration as done in Session 87
(`fetch_reference_recordings()` updated), but `TaxaLikely::.xc_recording_count()`
(`R/coverage.R`, added Session 119 — *after* that migration) was never updated and called
the dead v2 endpoint. Because `.xc_recording_count()` checked `resp_status != 200L` and
returned `NA_integer_` silently, `audit_acoustic_coverage(xc_recordings = TRUE)` had
returned `NA` for every species, with no warning, from the moment it was written. Fixed
Session 125: switched to the v3 endpoint, added a required `key` param (read from the
`XC_API_KEY` env var), and rewrote the query to v3's tag-based syntax
(`gen:X sp:Y type:call`). Live-verified against real species. See
`TaxaLikely/CLAUDE.md`'s Known Footguns for the fix detail.

## Recent Breaking Changes

Full history (Sessions 19–123) in `ecosystem_docs/NAME_CHANGE_HISTORY.md`. This table
holds only changes newer than that archive — trimmed to empty as of Session 124 (the
prior "Sessions 47+" table fully duplicated the archive, which had already grown to
cover the same range; see `ecosystem_docs/REENTRY_PROMPT_session124...` for the note).
Add new rows here as breaking changes land; archive + clear again once this grows long.

| Session | Change | Package | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 125 | `audit_acoustic_coverage(xc_recordings = TRUE)` now returns real data | TaxaLikely | Behavioral, not signature. `.xc_recording_count()` migrated to Xeno-canto v3; requires `XC_API_KEY` env var (previously silently returned `NA` for every species regardless of key). |
| 125 | `correct_training_bias()` added | TaxaLikely | function | New preprocessing step, not yet called by any workflow. Divides classifier scores by an adaptive-shrinkage estimate of training-database representation bias before `unreferenced_candidates()`/`assign_scores()`. Overwrites `score_original` in place; raw value preserved in `score_uncorrected`. |
