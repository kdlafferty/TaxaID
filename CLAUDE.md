# CLAUDE.md — TaxaID Ecosystem
# Ecosystem-level context for Claude Code. Auto-loaded from any package subdirectory.
# Package-specific context lives in each package's own CLAUDE.md.
# Last updated: 2026-07-05 (Session 137 continued yet further, branch `single-observation-
# pipeline` — Phase 4 (DNA/BLAST half) of the observation-pipeline-wiring plan:
# `TaxaMatch::join_event_site_metadata()` added, producing a `site_df` for
# `build_site_table()` from an event-level detections table joined against a
# user-maintained site-metadata table — generalizes the ecosystem's existing
# blank-identification lookup-table pattern (`BLANKS_MARCH`/`BLANKS_AUG`,
# `control_samples`) to carry site coordinates. Data-type-agnostic by design (DNA/BLAST
# and acoustic reduce to the same join), but only the DNA/BLAST half is wired live this
# session — `TaxaID_Workflow_Template_TEST.R`'s Section 2.5 now uses the bundled
# `Reads_Table`'s real `sample_1`/`sample_2` columns as genuinely different sites,
# surfacing and fixing a real latent bug in Section 3's multi-member-vs-singleton
# branching (`build_site_table()` hardcodes `spatial_group_N = 1L` per row regardless of
# duplicates; branching now uses `nrow(group_sites)` instead of the stored column). The
# acoustic half stays deferred — no real multi-site BirdNET deployment data exists yet to
# wire against honestly; the user described two plausible real shapes (fixed BirdWeather-
# style recorders vs. multi-site field-trip submissions) but was explicitly unsure which
# applies, so `score_acoustic_workflow.R` only gets a documentation pointer. See
# `TaxaMatch/CLAUDE.md`'s Session 137-continued note for the full record.
# Session 137 continued further (same day, earlier) — Phase 3 of the observation-
# pipeline-wiring plan:
# `TaxaMatch/inst/workflows/score_image_workflow.R` gains an `OVERRIDE_SITE_LATLNG` flag
# (default TRUE, matching this script's bundled EXIF-less trail-camera photos) so the
# previously-unconditional site-coordinate override is now explicit rather than silently
# stomping on real per-photo EXIF GPS for other users' photo sets, plus a new
# `build_site_table()` call producing a checkpointed `image_site_table`. Live-verified
# both flag settings against the real bundled 52-photo set (82%/60% top-1 accuracy,
# matching prior documented results — no regression). See `TaxaMatch/CLAUDE.md`'s Session
# 137 note for detail.
# Session 137 continued (same day, earlier) — Phase 2 of the observation-pipeline-wiring
# plan: `inst/TaxaID_Workflow_Template_TEST.R`
# (the master 8-section workflow template) now wires spatial grouping end to end. New
# Section 2.5 builds a `site_table` (`TaxaMatch::build_site_table()` +
# `group_observations_by_bbox()`); Section 3's occurrence fetch branches per
# `spatial_group_id` (pooled bbox fetch for multi-member groups, per-observation
# taxonomic-escalation fetch via `TaxaTools::escalate_taxonomic_rank()` for singletons);
# Section 5 generates `TaxaExpect` priors once per group at that group's own resolved
# grid cell instead of one global `SITE_GRID_ID`; Section 7 joins each observation
# against its own group's priors (`join_priors()`'s existing multi-site data-frame path)
# and adds a new `TaxaAssign::update_prior_from_consensus(spatial_group_map = site_table)`
# call (previously not invoked anywhere in this template). The DNA/BLAST pathway still
# has no real per-observation site metadata (Phase 4, deferred) — every observation is
# placed at one hardcoded `STUDY_LAT`/`STUDY_LON` as a documented placeholder, so real
# multi-site behavior isn't exercised by this template's bundled test data yet, only the
# wiring itself. See `TaxaID/CLAUDE.md`'s own Session 137-continued note below for the
# verification approach and what's still deferred (Phases 4-7).
# Session 137 (earlier in the same day) — TaxaTools::escalate_taxonomic_rank() added: the
# escalation-ladder function (broaden genus -> family -> order when a singleton's own
# genus has no reference/occurrence data), Phase 1 of the same plan. Live-verified against
# real NCBI data for the PtConception 12S cases and the bobcat-photo case. See
# TaxaTools/CLAUDE.md's Session 137 note for detail.
# Session 134b, branch `single-observation-pipeline` — after
# reviewing Session 134's automatic-spatial-grouping implementation, the user raised package-
# placement questions before committing (see
# ecosystem_docs/REENTRY_PROMPT_session134b_grouping_implemented.md). Resolved: the shared
# interactive polygon gadget only needed a small additive generalization (color the points
# overlay by group; reopen a previous polygon for reshaping) to serve both TaxaFetch's
# search-area purpose and TaxaMatch's spatial-group purpose, so `define_search_polygon()`
# moved TaxaFetch -> TaxaTools and `group_observations_by_bbox()` moved TaxaFetch -> TaxaMatch
# (it operates on TaxaMatch::build_site_table()'s output; a spatial-grouping concern, not a
# fetch concern). `group_observations_by_bbox()` also substantially reworked: `spatial_group_id`
# now defaults to the observation's own `observation_id` (set by `build_site_table()`, not
# invented by the grouping function), last-drawn-wins overlap resolution with a warning, and a
# new end-of-loop review/edit/delete step. New `TaxaMatch::assign_spatial_group()` manual
# helper for metadata-known groupings. All three packages (TaxaTools, TaxaFetch, TaxaMatch)
# plus TaxaAssign (doc-only cross-reference fix) `devtools::check()`-clean. Still open for a
# follow-up session: the search-area-vs-spatial-group reconciliation, fetch-scope branching
# (the escalation-ladder engineering work), the Reads-table relocation, and the TaxaAssign
# (observation_id, site) schema question -- see the reentry prompt and each touched package's
# Session 134b note for the full record. Session 133 — acoustic tau/score_sharpness re-calibrated on a real, deliberately-designed 24-species/8-cluster/2487-detection-window dataset (up from a 3-species/42-window pilot); Session 128/129's "acoustic wants tau≈1, opposite of image" conclusion did NOT hold — pooled acoustic optimum is tau≈0, same as image, though per-cluster results are genuinely heterogeneous and one global tau may not be appropriate. No current real-data evidence supports tau>0 as a default for either data type. See TaxaLikely/CLAUDE.md's Session 133 note and ecosystem_docs/REENTRY_PROMPT_acoustic_tau_calibration_expanded.md for the full record. Session 132 — TaxaMatch non-portable camera-trap filenames fixed. Session 129 — real assign_scores() score-scale bug found and fixed; TaxaExpect crash fixes for sparse real data; new TaxaFetch::get_gbif_occurrences() unified wrapper; first real TaxaAssign posterior run for the camera-trap species set. See ecosystem_docs/REENTRY_PROMPT_session129_calibration_resolved.md for that record.)

## ⚙️ Claude Code Behavior
- After completing any task, play a completion sound: `afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff`
- Always ask before making changes to multiple *existing* files at once, or before any deletions
- Run `devtools::check()` after any substantive edits to a package

---

## 📋 Pending Documentation Tasks
- **pkgdown sites**: No `_pkgdown.yml` exists for any package. Per the MEE TaxaID
  manuscript plan (manuscript-context.md in Cowork), the paper will follow the
  aniMotum precedent — a short "Application"-style paper that points readers to
  package vignettes/docs for depth rather than including a full tutorial. This
  requires each package (at least TaxaTools, TaxaFetch, TaxaHabitat, TaxaMatch,
  TaxaLikely, TaxaExpect, TaxaAssign, TaxaFlag) to have a working pkgdown site
  before submission. Flagged June 2026 during manuscript planning.

## ⚠️ Reminder for Claude
**At the start of any session involving function changes, new functions, or name changes:
remind the user to update CLAUDE.md — especially the Function Inventory — before ending
the session. Also add significant renames to `ecosystem_docs/NAME_CHANGE_HISTORY.md`.**

---

## ⚠️ File Loss Incident — 6 March 2026
Several TaxaExpect source files were lost during a USGS Git repository migration on
6 March 2026. Affected files were subsequently recreated from scratch. If any function
behaviour seems inconsistent with documentation, the recreated version is authoritative.
Functions confirmed recreated after the incident: `make_bbox_wkt`, `get_keys_from_context`,
`fetch_gbif_occurrences`, `create_sites_from_grid`, `optimize_grid_size`,
`filter_gbif_quality`, `assign_habitat_biological`.

## Developer Environment

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| OS | macOS |
| R version | R version 4.5.2 (2025-10-31) |
| Primary IDE | RStudio |
| Git remotes | `origin` → https://github.com/kdlafferty/TaxaID (public monorepo, Session 80) |
| R library | `~/Library/R/4.0/library` — set via `R_LIBS_USER` in `~/.Renviron`, **not** `~/.Rprofile` (corrected Session 134b; see that session's TaxaTools/CLAUDE.md note). This project has its own `TaxaID.Rproj` + project-level `.Rprofile`, which RStudio sources *instead of* `~/.Rprofile` when the project is open — so `~/.Rprofile`'s own `.libPaths()` call (pointing at a directory that doesn't even exist, `~/Library/R/4.5-arm64/library`) never actually runs in this project. Confirmed directly: a real `R` session started from the project root resolves `.libPaths()[1]` to `~/Library/R/4.0/library`, and that's where `find.package()` finds every TaxaID package. `Rscript` (no project context) also lands here by default via `R_LIBS_USER`. The system default library (`/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.5-arm64/Resources/library`, i.e. `.Library`) is a same-R-version fallback, not the primary install target — don't rely on it matching what's actually loaded. |

## The TaxaID Ecosystem

| Package | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|
| TaxaTools | Name verification, cleaning, parsing, rank lookup, column standardisation; **LLM provider functions** (call_api, call_anthropic_api etc.); **LLM text generation** (draft_methods_text, draft_results_text); **GBIF backbone census** (census_genus_species); **Common name lookup** (common_to_scientific) | In development |
| TaxaFetch | Occurrence data acquisition (GBIF, DataONE, PDF, literature search), source combination | In development |
| TaxaHabitat | Habitat assignment via LLM, spatial QAQC; depends on TaxaTools for LLM calls | New (Session 28) |
| TaxaMatch | Sequence input (DADA2/FASTA), BLAST search, match standardization; BirdNET/image classifier ingestion | In development |
| TaxaLikely | Convert match scores to likelihoods using hierarchical Bayesian model; reference QC | New (Session 30) |
| TaxaExpect | Use occurrence and habitat data to estimate a theta prior for a taxon at a particular location | In development |
| TaxaAssign | Calculate posterior probability for a taxonomic assignment given a likelihood and a prior | In development |
| TaxaFlag | Flag anomalous detections: contamination (lab/field blanks), allochthonous transport, taxonomic scope, handler artifacts | New (Session 60) |
| TaxaWizard | Conversational workflow designer: LLM-powered interview → .R script, .md methods, or Shiny app | New (Session 68) |

**Ecosystem logic (scored pathway):** TaxaTools cleans names → TaxaFetch fetches occurrence data → TaxaHabitat assigns habitats → TaxaMatch standardizes match data → TaxaLikely converts scores to likelihoods → TaxaExpect builds priors → TaxaAssign computes posteriors → TaxaFlag flags anomalous detections. TaxaWizard sits outside the dependency chain (generates scripts that call the other packages).

**Ecosystem logic (no-score pathway):** When match scores are unavailable or a single best candidate is returned, TaxaMatch and the likelihood model are bypassed. `TaxaLikely::unreferenced_candidates()` adds H2/H3 placeholder rows; `TaxaLikely::assign_scores()` sets likelihoods: (1) `score_type = "none"` — uniform likelihoods = 1.0, posteriors proportional to priors (morphology / expert IDs); (2) `score_type = "similarity_softmax"` — for single-score classifiers (e.g. BirdNET top-1), modulates likelihoods by classifier confidence; (3) upranked consensus — same as (1). `expand_consensus_candidates()` is deprecated (Session 99). Output feeds TaxaAssign normally.

**Dependency chain:** TaxaTools → TaxaFetch → TaxaHabitat → TaxaExpect → TaxaAssign → TaxaFlag
TaxaMatch → TaxaLikely → TaxaAssign → TaxaFlag
consensus df → TaxaLikely (unreferenced_candidates + assign_scores) → TaxaAssign → TaxaFlag
TaxaWizard: no TaxaID dependencies (uses metadata JSON files as interface)

**Package split notes:**
- Session 19: TaxaFetch split out of TaxaExpect (owns data acquisition)
- Session 28: TaxaHabitat split out of TaxaFetch (owns habitat assignment + spatial QAQC); LLM provider functions moved to TaxaTools
- Session 30: TaxaMatch scope revised to thin shell; TaxaLikely created to own score→likelihood conversion
- Session 60: TaxaFlag created for post-assignment anomalous detection flagging
- Session 68: TaxaWizard created for conversational workflow design (outside dependency chain)

**Licensing:** All packages use CC0 1.0 (public domain, per USGS policy). TaxaExpect depends on glmmTMB (GPL >= 3); source is CC0 but binary distributions bundling glmmTMB may be subject to GPL terms.

## Shared Data Interface

- Classification paths: pipe `|` delimited
- Rank labels: pipe `|` delimited, aligned positionally with classification path
- Spatial terminology (strict):
  - `point_id` = exact lat/lon coordinate identifier (created before gridding)
  - `grid_id` = aggregated spatial cell identifier (encodes location ONLY — never habitat)
- Likelihood / prior / posterior object structure: TBD — see TaxaAssign CLAUDE.md

## Developer Workflow Reminder (macOS / RStudio)

```r
devtools::document()   # ALWAYS: regenerates NAMESPACE and .Rd files
devtools::test()       # run tests within the package project (uses load_all)
devtools::install()    # required before using library(Package) from another project
```

**When to run what:**

| Situation | Command | Speed |
|---|---|---|
| Editing code, running `devtools::test()` inside the package | Nothing extra — `load_all()` is implicit | Fast |
| Changed roxygen docs or added/removed exports | `devtools::document()` | Fast |
| Need to use the package from another project (`library(Package)`) | `devtools::install()` | Slow |
| Stale namespace / unexplained errors after switching branches | Restart R, then `library(Package)` | Medium |

**Rule:** `document()` alone for in-package editing/testing; add `install()` when
switching to another project that calls the package.

**⚠️ Claude Code instruction: whenever you make changes that require reinstall,**
**end your response with an explicit "To apply these changes" block using this exact pattern:**

**If only TaxaTools changed:**
```r
.rs.restartR()
devtools::install("~/My Drive/Rscripts/projects/TaxaID/TaxaTools")
.rs.restartR()
```

**If multiple packages changed, or if unsure which downstream packages are affected:**
```r
.rs.restartR()
source("~/My Drive/Rscripts/projects/TaxaID/ecosystem_docs/install_all.R")
.rs.restartR()
```

**Always include two `.rs.restartR()` calls** — the first clears the stale session before
installing, the second ensures the freshly installed packages are loaded cleanly.
The `source()` line installs all packages in dependency order without opening each project.
Do not tell the user to use Session → Restart R or Cmd+Shift+F10 (does not work on this machine).

## Coding Conventions

- Native pipe `|>` throughout — never `%>%`
- `utils::globalVariables()` must be **first line** of every R file that uses NSE column names; omit entirely from files with no NSE references
- No blank lines inside `@param` roxygen blocks
- Helper/internal functions: `.` prefix + `@noRd`
- `package::function()` style for cross-package calls
- `%||%` exported from TaxaTools — never redefine in downstream packages; import via `@importFrom TaxaTools %||%`
- **`llm_fn` pattern**: LLM-calling functions accept `llm_fn = call_api` param (default via `getOption("TaxaID.llm_fn")`); users pass compatible wrapper for other providers

---

## ⚠️ Known R Footguns

### Split-string sprintf bug (recurring)
`sprintf()` does NOT concatenate multiple string arguments.
```r
# WRONG — crashes with "invalid format '%d'"
warning(sprintf("Message with %d items: ", "extra string", count))
# CORRECT
warning(sprintf("Message with %d items: extra string", count))
```
Check all `sprintf`/`warning`/`message`/`stop` calls before delivering any file.

### Roxygen blank lines inside @param
Blank line inside `@param` block → `devtools::document()` fails silently.

### read.csv numeric coercion of IUCN codes
`read.csv` parses `"9.2"` as `<double>`. Always `as.character()` before joining
against `.iucn_habitat_lookup$l2_code`.

### Logical parameter NA validation
`is.logical(NA)` returns `TRUE`. Always add `|| is.na(x)`:
```r
if (!is.logical(strict) || length(strict) != 1L || is.na(strict)) stop(...)
```

### \tabular in roxygen blocks
Use `\itemize` or `\describe` instead. If `devtools::document()` runs but does not
print "Writing <function>.Rd", a broken `\tabular` block is the first thing to check.

### taxon_match / geo_match column collision (Session 25)
`search_literature()` pre-initialises `geo_match = NA` and `taxon_match = NA`.
If screening fails partway and leaves stale values, a subsequent `left_join` creates
`.x`/`.y` duplicates. Always drop stale screening columns before rebuilding the prompt.

### prompt_api() breaking change (Session 26)
Renamed from `prompt_anthropic_api` to `prompt_api`. Params `model`, `max_tokens`,
`api_key` removed — now handled via closure passed to `llm_fn`. See TaxaFetch CLAUDE.md.

### PCRE `sub()` does not match newlines without `(?s)` (Session 33)
`sub(".*?(\\[[\\s\\S]*\\]).*", "\\1", x, perl=TRUE)` silently returns `x` unchanged
when `x` contains newlines, because `.*` in PCRE does not match `\n` by default.
Fix: add `(?s)` inline flag: `sub("(?s).*?(\\[...]\\]).*", "\\1", x, perl=TRUE)`.
This affected `assign_taxa_llm()` in TaxaAssign — LLM responses wrapped in markdown
fences were never parsed, causing all-NA `range_status` and uniform priors.

### `.resolve_llm_fn()` default silently degrades under fully-namespaced calls (Session 123)
`assign_taxa_llm()`, `run_llm_pipeline()`, `build_context()`, `suggest_unreferenced_species()`
(TaxaAssign) and `review_assignments()` (TaxaFlag) all default `llm_fn` to
`getOption("TaxaID.llm_fn", TaxaTools::call_api)`. `call_api()`'s provider
auto-detection depends on `TaxaTools::.onAttach()` having run, which only happens via
`library(TaxaTools)` — never via `TaxaTools::function()`. Code that calls these
functions using only namespaced (`::`) calls therefore never triggers auto-detection,
and `call_api()` **silently falls back to uniform/degraded output instead of
erroring**. No warning, no error — just a suspiciously uniform result. Caught only by
noticing the output looked wrong, in the TaxaID Layer-1 workflow scripts (which use
namespaced calls exclusively). Fix: always pass `llm_fn` explicitly when calling any
of the five functions above from a fully-namespaced script:
```r
llm_fn = getOption("TaxaID.llm_fn", TaxaTools::call_anthropic_api)
```

### Xeno-canto v2 API is dead; v2→v3 migration in Session 87 missed one call site (found Session 124, FIXED Session 125)
`ecosystem_docs/NAME_CHANGE_HISTORY.md` records the v2→v3 migration as done in Session 87
(`fetch_reference_recordings()` updated), but `TaxaLikely::.xc_recording_count()`
(`R/coverage.R`, added Session 119 — *after* that migration) was never updated and called
the dead v2 endpoint. Because `.xc_recording_count()` checked `resp_status != 200L` and
returned `NA_integer_` silently, `audit_acoustic_coverage(xc_recordings = TRUE)` had
returned `NA` for every species, with no warning, from the moment it was written. Fixed
Session 125: switched to the v3 endpoint, added a required `key` param (read from the
`XC_API_KEY` env var), and rewrote the query to v3's tag-based syntax
(`gen:X sp:Y type:call`). Live-verified against real species. See
`TaxaLikely/CLAUDE.md`'s Known Footguns for the fix detail.

### RStudio's `dialogViewer()` can silently swallow a Shiny gadget's Done button when the gadget contains a `leaflet` map (found Session 134b)
`TaxaTools::define_search_polygon()` (a `miniUI`/`shiny` gadget with a `leaflet` map)
worked fine in earlier sessions but started returning `NULL` on every call in Session
134b, even when the user clicked **Done** (not Cancel) -- confirmed reproducible, not a
one-off. A *minimal* gadget (title bar + Done button, no leaflet) worked correctly with
`shiny::dialogViewer()` in the same RStudio session, ruling out a general
`shiny`/`miniUI` problem. The *exact* production gadget code worked correctly when its
viewer was swapped to `shiny::browserViewer()` (opens in a real browser) -- confirmed
both via the calling R session receiving the correct return value and via directly
inspecting the live page with Claude's Chrome browser-automation tools. `paneViewer()`
was then also tested directly against this exact gadget and confirmed working too.
Conclusion: on at least one real RStudio setup, the embedded `dialogViewer()` webview
specifically mishandles a gadget's Leaflet content in a way that breaks the Done
button's click-to-server round trip, while the identical gadget works fine via either
`browserViewer()` or `paneViewer()`. **If you write or modify any Shiny gadget in this
ecosystem that embeds a `leaflet` map, do not assume `dialogViewer()` works -- use
`shiny::paneViewer()` instead**, matching this ecosystem's existing mapping gadgets
(`TaxaTools::define_search_polygon()`, `TaxaHabitat::review_spatial_flags()`,
`TaxaExpect::plot_theta_map_interactive()` all use it, for one consistent
map-interaction style) -- and only use `dialogViewer()` if you've confirmed it
round-trips a real click on the actual machine you're targeting.
Also see this same debugging session's now-corrected R library documentation just above
(Developer Environment table) -- a stale-library-cache theory looked very plausible for
several rounds before being ruled out by directly checking `.libPaths()` from a real
session; don't skip that direct check next time something "should be fixed but isn't."
See `TaxaTools/CLAUDE.md`'s Session 134b note for the full multi-round debugging record.

## Recent Breaking Changes

Full history (Sessions 19–123) in `ecosystem_docs/NAME_CHANGE_HISTORY.md`. This table
holds only changes newer than that archive — trimmed to empty as of Session 124 (the
prior "Sessions 47+" table fully duplicated the archive, which had already grown to
cover the same range; see `ecosystem_docs/REENTRY_PROMPT_session124...` for the note).
Add new rows here as breaking changes land; archive + clear again once this grows long.

| Session | Change | Package | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 125 | `audit_acoustic_coverage(xc_recordings = TRUE)` now returns real data | TaxaLikely | Behavioral, not signature. `.xc_recording_count()` migrated to Xeno-canto v3; requires `XC_API_KEY` env var (previously silently returned `NA` for every species regardless of key). |
| 125 | `correct_training_bias()` added | TaxaLikely | New preprocessing step, not yet called by any workflow. Divides classifier scores by an adaptive-shrinkage estimate of training-database representation bias before `unreferenced_candidates()`/`assign_scores()`. Overwrites `score_original` in place; raw value preserved in `score_uncorrected`. |
| 127 | `correct_training_bias(prior_weight = NULL)` → `correct_training_bias(tau = 1.0)` | TaxaLikely | Signature change. `prior_weight` param removed; `tau` added (single fixed global exponent, not adaptive per-candidate). Literature-grounded revision (Menon et al. 2020 logit adjustment) — see `TaxaLikely/CLAUDE.md`'s Session 127 note. Still not called by any workflow, so no downstream callers affected. |
| 136 | `fetch_reference_sequences()` → `fetch_ncbi_reference_sequences()` | TaxaLikely | Function rename. Old name didn't say NCBI anywhere; needed to disambiguate once a second live-API reference source (`fetch_bold_reference_sequences()`, BOLD Systems) existed. Old name kept as a deprecated forwarding alias (`.Deprecated()`, matches `audit_barcode_coverage_ncbi()`'s pattern) — all internal call sites (`build_site_reference()`, workflows, README, TaxaWizard snippets) updated to the new name directly. |
| 136 | `fetch_bold_reference_sequences()` added | TaxaLikely | New reference-fetch function, BOLD Systems analog of `fetch_ncbi_reference_sequences()`. Talks directly to BOLD's real v5 Data Portal API via `httr2` (no `bold` package dependency — that package targets BOLD's now-retired v3/v4 API and no longer works). Live-tested end to end. See `TaxaLikely/CLAUDE.md`'s Session 136 note. |
